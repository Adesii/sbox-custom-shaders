A lot of this shader was inspired and adapted from this youtube video:

it was a great learning experience and this shader wouldn't have been possible without their great explanation of shaders.

# Notice:
The mesh that this Shader is applied to needs to have BakeLighting Disabled otherwise the whole mesh will just be black. Waiting for Sam to push the sunlight rework. but until then you'll need to disable that on each mesh using this shader
