Shaders that I Created for SBox,

Here i'll be storing all my finished or WIP shaders

# Guide

Take the vfx folder and drag that into YOURADDON/shaders/

the final path should look like YOURADDON/shaders/vfx/fancy_grass.ini (example path for the ini file)

if you want to develop the shaders just drag and drop the other files into your shaders folder.
YOURADDON/shaders/fancy_grass.vfx
